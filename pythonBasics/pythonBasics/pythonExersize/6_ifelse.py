# Practice using if-else statements.
# Write a program that assigns a greeting to a variable.
#
# Use an if statement to check if the greeting is "Hello".
#
# If it matches, print "Hello there!" and "How can I assist you today?".
#
# If it does not match, print "Greetings!".
#
# After the if-else block, print "Program has completed."
#
# Expected Output:
#
# If greeting is "Hello":
#
# Hello there!
# How can I assist you today?
# Program has completed.
# If greeting is not "Hello":
#
# Greetings!
# Program has completed.




# greeting = "Hello"
# if greeting == "Hello":
#     print("Hello there!\nHow can I assist you today?")
# else:
#     print("Greetings!")
# print("Program has completed.")

# if b>10:
